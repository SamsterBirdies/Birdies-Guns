# Birdies-Guns
 The official repository for the mod "Birdies' GUNS" for Forts on the Steam workshop.
 
I am unlikely to add much more weapons to the mod. If you wish to add more weapons, please fork this repo.
 
You are allowed to upload your own version of Birdies Guns to the Forts steam workshop or copy anything from this mod for use on the Forts steam workshop
 
 To get sound working in the mod, download FMOD studio version 2.1.6 and import the project folder "BirdiesGuns2.1.6".
 Delete the master bank, create a new master bank, and re-assign the sound events to that bank.
 Then "Build" the bank (F7), and copy the .bank files into BirdiesGuns/audio/
 
 Alternatively, if you don't want to use FMOD studio, the sound files are in BirdiesGuns2.1.6/Assets/
 
Changing the "sb" prefixes in the mod will also be appreciated for maxium compatibility.
